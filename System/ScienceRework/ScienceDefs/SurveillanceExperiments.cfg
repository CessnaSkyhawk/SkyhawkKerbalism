	RESULTS
	{
		SunInSpaceHigh = She is very bright and very beautiful. Kerbol, the star that keeps Kerbalkind alive...
		SunInSpaceLow = The light coming off Kerbol has made the image pure white! You're lucky you didn't damage the camera...
		MunInSpaceLow = The gray, cratered surface in this image can make one philosophical about the uniqueness of their existence.
		MunInSpaceLow = The darker volcanic plains, the mountains, hills, and valleys all remind you of Kerbin. You can see why the astronomers of the Proot Era thought the Mun was another world, with people not unlike our own. //@Proot, creator of the KSP Renaissance Compilation
		MunInSpaceLow = You see some rocks. Or were those rovers? or bases? At this distance, it's hard to tell. But you can tell that they were big. can see anything in them.
		MunInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. But does this image show any evidence of enemy mun bases?
			    MunInSpaceLowMidlands = The possibly igneous small flats are peppered by small craters and rocks.
			    MunInSpaceLowMidlands = Light-colored ejecta from some craters is visible and not dark igneous rock, so we can now absolutely, definitively prove that even the smallest ones are impact craters.
			    MunInSpaceLowMidlands = There are plenty of rocks here, at least we think those are rocks. At  this distance it's hard to tell if they're natural of artificial, like a rover or something.
			    MunInSpaceLowMidlandCraters = This area of the midlands has a high concentration of craters big, small, and everything in between. At least we now have a map of them all. 
			    MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands have a slightly lighter appearance, with the frequency of craters-in-craters suggesting that these may contain some of the oldest rock in the Kerbin system. Their overall shape is also reminiscent of the hills and mountains of Kerbin.
			    MunInSpaceLowHighlandCraters = The large craters, seemingly eroded by aeons of meteorite impacts and solar wind, have plenty of evidence to suggest their old age, and by extension the age of the rest of the highlands.
			    MunInSpaceLowCanyons = These large canyons, probably formed by the force of the same impacts as the large craters they're connected to, are somewhat reminiscent of rovers spilling out into oceans or lakes. No evidence of enemy bases, unfortunately.
			    MunInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = Observations of details in the visual scan may indicate that this basin was formed by lava welling up after a large asteroid impact.
			    MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = Despite its prominence when viewed from the surface of Kerbin, these relatively close-up observations confirm that this is in fact just a crater, nothing special. Early astronomers thought that this was a dried-up lake.
			    MunInSpaceLowNorthwestCrater = This crater seems eroded, almost like its walls unevenly crumbled after it was formed. Beware of potentially soft rock.
			    MunInSpaceLowSouthwestCrater = Like the East Crater, this is a completely ordinary impact crater. The surface inside is occupied by scattered rocks and smaller craters.
			    MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = Never seen before from Kerbin, this crater looks somewhat younger than the other large craters, the ejecta being faint but still visible.
			    MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = The two craters are remarkably similar despite potentially being millions of years apart in age. The short trench or canyon connecting them likely formed with the younger, larger one.
			    MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = Despite never being seen from above is such detail before, it feels quite familiar. Kerbin looms just over the horizon, sitting there, a reminder of the Mun's tidal lock and the incoming far side, never seen by kerbal eyes before.
			    MunInSpaceLowPolarCrater = This is a large crater, the largest on the Mun. Slight glimmers of light in the shadow of the crater rim may signify a deposit of water ice here! Otherwise, you can see rocks. We're sure none of those glimmers were missions on the Mun, neither ours nor the Kerviets'. 
			    MunInSpaceLowPoles = The polar regions. Not bright and shiny as Kerbin's poles,which means that while these are quite boring, our cameras can reveal more detail in them than on Kerbin's poles. Some of the higher areas receive sunlight year-round, but they shadow the polar lowlands where in some places it is permanently dark. The temperature gradient on the surface would be interesting, but this is an optical device. Not an infrared one.
			    MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = The permanently shadowed craters may contain water ice, possibly in high enough concentration to be harvested in the future. Kerbol is permanently on the horizon, and in the lower parts may have never been seen in the history of the Mun. Great hiding place.
			
			MinmusInSpaceLowFlats = The wide flats seem impossibly smooth, even up close. What are they? Craters filled with volcanic material, like the Mun's lowlands? Salt flats formed from lakes once kept warm by the heat of celestial formation? Or mint ice cream, left there for hungry kerbals?
        MinmusInSpaceLowGreaterFlats = The biggest flats on Minmus conjure up images of mint ice cream or shaved ice, with the shiny, icy surface glinting in the sunlight. You close the aperture before the bright light overwhelms the camera.
        MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands and the surrounding midlands are so obviously rock, but what is the sparkly blue-green surface made of? Salt? Copper oxide ore? Blue ice? We'll never know unless we look beyond the visible, which this instrument is unfortunately incapable of doing.
        MinmusInSpaceLowHighlands = The flatness of the highland plateaus is remarkable, especially since they aren't at Minmus mean 'sea' level. Maybe these were the original surface of Minmus, before the lower flats formed?
        MinmusInSpaceLowGreatFlats = These somewhat resemble the ice caps of Kerbin, either that or salt flats. The dessert theory seems to be less credible now, not that it was ever a serious consideration.
        MinmusInSpaceLowLesserFlats = These look like ice lakes shrouded in the mountains, reminding everyone of such things on Kerbin, and the fact that even this far away, you are still in the (gravitational) influence of home.
        MinmusInSpaceLowSlopes = The slopes are reminiscent of mountainsides on Kerbin, the perfect place to put an observatory. We can't spot any of those, though.
        MinmusInSpaceLowLowlands = The lowlands are like Kerbin's grasslands, with the small hills and gentle slope up to the midlands. They seem like an good spot to set up a long-term base if the flats are proven to be ice sheets over subsurface oceans. Future missions should beware of boulders though.
        MinmusInSpaceLow = You see in detail its large flats, light greenish-blue color and almost sparkly look. Apparent cracks on the surface may land credence to the theory that Minmus is covered in ice, and that the flats are, or were, the surface of internal oceans. The cause of the color is as yet unknown.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus reveals varying terrain. High plateaus stretch for kilometres and the plains below them stretch even farther.
				MinmusInSpaceHigh = From so far away, Minmus resembles a small scoop of mint ice cream...

		MohoInSpaceLow = Craters become clear on Moho's surface. With immense detail, the craters have craters. This reminds you that you are too close for comfort...
			MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho floats far away, punished with craters. You can almost see the heat of the home star, Kerbol...

				EveInSpaceLow = Eve greets you with great delight as you swoop past, revealing how vast her Explodium Oceans are. You now want a grape popsicle...
					EveInSpaceHigh = Eve shimmers with its purple hue down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember...

		GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly, a beige captured asteroid reveals very extreme terrain. A blur in the photo shows its fast rotation.
			GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly barely resembles a dot in the photo.

				DunaInSpaceLow = Duna has a vide variety of terrain, ranging from deep chasms, to tall mountain ranges, and plains. Its ice caps are large and dominant of the poles.
					DunaInSpaceHigh = The pale orange dot resembles a ball or rust, or a red velvet cupcake...

		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches.
			IkeInSpaceHigh = The rock we call Ike is massive. It appears to be quite dense from so far away. It also appears to have very rugged terrain, more so than your own moon.

		DresInSpaceLow = Closer to Dres now, you begin to collect evidence that she is not a planet, but she is a dwarf planet which once was a gargantuan rogue asteroid.
			DresInSpaceHigh = Dres reminds you of the Mun. It holds quite uneven terrain with a grey hue.

			JoolInSpaceLow = The green hue of Jool dominates the photo with great immensity.
				JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's many moons are seen fantastically before her like a ballet of crumbs around that key lime cake you just devoured.

				LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe has islands, water, and an atmosphere. You wouldn't be suprised if we found microkerbals here...
					LaytheInSpaceHigh = From here, Laythe looks like a pale blue marble.

			VallInSpaceLow = Vall holds blue plains and lighter blue mountains ranges that snake around the planet's surface in every which way.
				VallInSpaceHigh = Vall stands valiant, far away, as a pale blue dot.

		TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo is humongous. It is a massive rock the size of Kerbin. The speckles turn out to be tens of thousands of craters. Tylo reveals a highly beaten surface like the Mun. The scientists in the lab infer that Tylo does indeed have trace amounts of cobalt.
			TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo, from so far out, appears to be speckled. Why didn't we name it Spot?

		BopInSpaceLow = Bop appears to reveal a crater with a white rim, which perhaps, could be evidence of a young captured Bop in a young Joolian system.
			BopInSpaceHigh = Bop seems to be a brown captured asteroid not unlike Gilly. Perhaps they are related?

		PolInSpaceLow = Pol seems unforgiving. Like her sister Bop, she seems to be a captured asteroid. The rough, jagged, and derranged terrain make you think twice about landing.
			PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, the speck across the way, reminds you of a pollen grain.

		EelooInSpaceLow = Eeloo shows its true self as you approach, revealing her ice canyons and chasms.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo appears to be very icy. It's spent too long this far away from Kerbol.
