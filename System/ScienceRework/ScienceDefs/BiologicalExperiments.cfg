	RESULTS	
	{
		default = He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well. He's finally back to kick some tail. His Coconut Gun can fire in spurts. If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt. He's bigger, faster, and stronger too. He's the first member of the D.K. crew!
		default = Finally, he's here for you. It's the last member of the D.K. crew. This Kong's so strong, it isn't funny. Can make a Kremling cry out for mummy. Can pick up a boulder with relative ease. Makes crushing rocks seem such a breeze. He may move slow, he can't jump high. But this Kong's one hell of a guy!
