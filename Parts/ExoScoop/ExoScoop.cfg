	description = Apparently someone went wild with a very large heap of discarded laundry baskets and a shed load of Copper wire. This device can generate a conical magnetic field modestly larger than its physical frame, enabling effective uptake of gaseous particles into the filtration system which then leads to the best part... refilling the tank.
